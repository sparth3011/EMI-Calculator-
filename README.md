# EMI-Calculator-
This Python project is an EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) calculator that helps users calculate the monthly installment amount they need to pay for a loan. It's a simple command-line tool that takes input for the loan amount, interest rate, and loan tenure, and then computes the EMI, displaying the result to the user.
